here is a small presentation of my knowledge on languages(HTML , CSS, JS).
I have used the HTML code to give the game its Strecture.
Then CSS is for generallising the design of the game giving it a very user friendly interface for intracting.
The Java Script handles the functioning of the game behind at its run time.
This game can be possibly played by a single player.
The user can connect a external mouse to his pc and a player 2 can also perform the actions in the  game.
